    <h2 style="margin-top: 28%; margin-left:42%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; " ><b>Tuning Is upgrade</b></h2>
    <p class="newspaper">Old engine out, more powerful engine in: This radical cure is often carried out, but strictly speaking it does not count as tuning for many tuning fans. For them, tuning is about improving, expanding or tuning existing vehicle parts so that they deliver more power.

        One measure of engine tuning is quite classically the enlargement of the cylinder capacity: In the process, the cylinder bore is enlarged – which is referred to as “boring” in the scene. Why does engine performance increase with larger cylinders? Quite simply: more air/fuel mixture can be burnt in larger cylinders than in smaller ones. This provides an increase in power.
        
        Turbocharging the engine is another way to increase engine power. With the help of turbochargers or superchargers, it is possible to increase the mean pressure and thus the power. The higher pressure improves the degree of filling so that more air is available for the combustion of fuel.
        
        Chip tuning does not require any intervention in the mechanics of the engine. Here, the engine performance is increased through targeted changes to the factory-set control parameters of the electronic engine management system. In this way, the boost pressure of the turbocharger or the amount of fuel to be injected into the combustion chamber can be increased. The measures lead to an increase in engine power and torque.</p>
